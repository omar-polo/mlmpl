# mlmpl

mlmpl is a mailing (and news) list manager written in perl.  It's
meant to be used as mta script.

While it has been used to run a small/medium-ish list (~500 users), I
lost almost all the files in the original repository, except for the
scripts.  I'm trying to polish it and make it usable again.
